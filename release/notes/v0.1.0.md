This is the first public release of paseto-cli! :tada:

It started as a light wrapper around the go-paseto library with a more ergonomic API, but I also needed a CLI tool for working with PASETO.

It doesn't do anything special that similar tools don't do already, but it served as a way for me to get familiar with PASETO and the shortcomings of JWT. Plus as with any NIH tool, I personally trust mine more than the alternatives. :blush:

The basic functionality is implemented, and the test coverage is decent (78%). There likely won't be any new major releases, just bug fixes.
